                            <p>For the last couple of days I have been sailing through the Aegean Sea. We stopped to visit the Skopelos Island in Greece early in the morning. After we had our breakfast, I decided that is time to explore. </p>

                            <p>We rented a car and started to visit different beaches and cool shops. We stopped at one cafe, where the people next to us talked about the Mama Mia cliff.</p>

                            <p>I was shocked when I found out that it was located on this very island I was on. And of course, we had to go there!</p>

                            <p>The road was pretty bumpy, but we managed to get there. It was beautiful! There are very high stairs that lead you to the church, which is the main attraction. The wedding in the Mamma Mia movie was filmed in the church. It was really breathtaking and I felt very lucky for this opportunity. </p>
                            <p>We didn't stay long, because the sun was setting and we had to get to our boat before dark. The next day we were going to another place. Stay tuned for the next blog!</p>
